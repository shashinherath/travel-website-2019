        <h2>ADVENTURE | FLY | NATURE</h2>
        <p>Imagine yourself floating gracefully over the spectacular lands of Sri Lanka with beautiful rivers, magical forests, green mountains and ancient historical sites. Hot air ballooning is a relatively new activity, but it’s gaining more popularity each year. It’s a unique way to see the country and there are no two routes alike so you are guaranteed to have a unique experience. All the balloons are manufactured in Great Britain and the pilots also train there. During the flight a special ground crew follows the air balloon in jeep and makes sure that everything is alright.</p>
        
        <p>Air ballooning heavily depends on the weather so you can’t book too far in advance. The best time to enjoy this activity is late autumn to early spring. The whole experience lasts for around 4 hours and includes balloon inflation, arrival, briefing, flight, landing, and a short breakfast with champagne and snacks.</p>
        
        <p>Balloon trips are usually scheduled in the morning so you could watch the sunrise in the air. Takeoff starts soon after dawn which is around 6-7 a.m. depending on the season. It’s best to ask your hotel to arrange a wakeup call so you would wake up on time. Hot air balloon tours are usually all-inclusive and you’ll be provided with an A/C car to transfer and from the point of takeoff. It is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience that shouldn’t be missed.</p>
        
        <p>- kids under 7 years old and pregnant ladies will not be allowed to take the balloon flight.<br> - You are advised to allocate a maximum of 4 hours for your balloon excursion's ( from pick up to drop off ).<br> - Pick up time 4.30, 5am depend on the location.<br> - If a flight is cancelled due to bad weather we do not charge and payment is refunded in full case of advance payment.</p>
