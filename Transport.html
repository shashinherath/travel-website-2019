        <h1>Transport</h1>
        <p><i>Public Transportation in Sri Lanka is based mainly on the road network which is centered on Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo. Buses, three-wheelers and trains make up the public transport system. Airports, harbors and waterways are also there. Most of the roads in Sri Lanka are in good condition; however some roads in the rural areas might not be up to standards. Below are a list of means of transport that you can consider while visiting Sri Lanka.
