The route from Ella to Kandy is considered the most picturesque in the whole country so if you want to enjoy some train travel – this is the perfect way to do it. It is quite a tourist attraction so be prepared to make lots of new friends along the way. Enjoy local treats like mango with cinnamon, freshly cut pineapple and crispy papadums, rice and curry, corn with butter and manymany more. Another beautiful route is Pollonaruwa – Colombo, which offers a wide range of gorgeous sceneries along the way.</p>
